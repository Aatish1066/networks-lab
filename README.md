Introduction
Computer networks are a fundamental aspect of modern computing, and understanding the algorithms that power them is essential. This repository serves as a collection of well-documented and implemented network algorithms in Java. The code in this repository is specifically tailored for use in network labs, providing a practical learning environment for students and researchers.

Algorithms
The repository currently includes implementations of the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: A popular algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a network graph.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm: An algorithm that finds the shortest path in a weighted graph, even in the presence of negative weight edges.
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: A dynamic programming algorithm that solves the all-pairs shortest path problem in a weighted graph.
Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.
Spanning Tree Algorithms: Implementations of various algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees, such as Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.
Routing Algorithms: Examples of routing algorithms, including the Distance-Vector Routing Algorithm and Link-State Routing Algorithm.
Congestion Control Algorithms: Implementations of congestion control algorithms, like TCP Tahoe and TCP Reno.
Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and new algorithms may be added in the future. The code is well-documented, organized, and designed specifically for laboratory environments, making it easy to understand and integrate into your experiments.
